DeMMO1,105,150,"DeMMO1 (historical name 10-1) was the tenth diamond borehole drilled at the Homestake Mine circa 1910. It is 1400 ft long (427 m) drilled eastward, away from any documented mining excavations. The bit drifted upward during drilling, terminating near Whitewood Creek. This borehole starts in Ellison Formation lithologies of chlorite-mica-garnet schists and phyllites, transitioning into unidentified metaigneous amphibolites, and subsequently tertiary intrusive rhyolites. The borehole log notes intersecting a water course at the hole terminus, which may be the current source of abundant flow (averages 2.5 L/min)."
DeMMO2,315.644,150,"DeMMO2 (historical name #19223) intersects a complex region of folded Ellison, Homestake, and Poorman formations in an area with extensive sulfide mineralization and mined stopes. The hole begins in well-banded tan, brown, and gray phyllites of the Ellison Formation, followed by yellow-banded and mineral-rich Homestake Formation phyllites, gray Ð green and brown Poorman Formation phyllites, and rhyolitic to porphyritic intrusive igneous rocks. Significant minerals noted on the bore hole logs are graphite, sericite, cummingtonite, chlorite, chert, siderite, carbonate, biotite, quartz, fluorite, pyrrhotite, pyrite, and arsenopyrite."
DeMMO3,500,133,"DeMMO3 (historical name #24790) is uniquely situated in a remote region of the 2000 ft level and was drilled in 1999 during the final phase of mining and exploration of the working Homestake Mine. This is a relatively short borehole (398 ft; 121 m) drilled at a steep upward angle. Intersected lithologies include gray to tan banded sericite, graphite, chert-bearing phyllites (Poorman Formation); gray green and white massive to banded Homestake Formation with biotite, sericite, chlorite, chert, vein quartz, graphite, siderite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, and arsenopyrite, and poorly banded sericite, graphite, and biotite phyllites (Ellison Formation). These rocks were not visibly intruded by tertiary volcanism. Currently the hole has strong flow (_1.5 L/min) and features periodic eruptions of gas bubbles and particulate iron oxides. Measured ORP is consistently high (average _28 mV) but dissolved oxygen is undetectable. The fluids are consistently brackish with an average conductivity of 3 mS."
DeMMO4,216.432,104,"DeMMO4 (historical name #24228) is on the 4100 ft level very near, but not intersecting the Ross Shaft. This hole is unusual in that it was drilled at a downward angle that, importantly for the geochemistry and habitability, limits contamination with oxygen from the mine atmosphere. The drilling log is relatively simple, spanning 941 ft (287 m) and featuring primarily Poorman Formation banded graphite-biotite phyllites that variably include carbonate, sericite, chlorite, and garnets. Pyrrhotite and pyrite mineralization is noted throughout the core."
DeMMO5,370,74,"DeMMO5 (historical name #11938) and D6 (historical name DUSEL B) are both on the 4850 ft level, but intersect very different rocks and feature different fluid chemistry. D5 (hole #11938) was drilled in 1978 during excavation of the 17-ledge mining area (see Figure 2A). It is 943 ft (287 m) long and intersects a wide range of lithologies. Notably this hole is in a drift with very significant modern fluid flow through both old boreholes and other fractures, commonly featuring abundant growth of white microbial biofilms and streamers. The trajectories of DeMMO4 and DeMMO5 trend toward a similar source area, between areas of significant excavation.  DeMMO5, however, intersects a much more diverse range of host lithologies, including the Poorman, Homestake, and Ellison formations as well as transitional facies between those units."
DeMMO6,215.071,75,"DeMMO6 was drilled in 2009 in preparation for construction of the proposed Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) facilities. This hole, along with its sister holes, in the same drift (DUSEL C, D, J, and 3A, not sampled), intersect the Yates Unit metabasalts with periodic rhyolitic tertiary dikes. D6 is 603 ft (184 m) long and was intentionally drilled in a direction of very limited mining influence where very significant fluid pressures were encountered. In contrast to the other fluids, those from D6 are much more saline, up to _8 mS. Logistical concerns prevented re-packering of this hole to a continuous flow system similar to the other DeMMO sites, however, we did install continuous flow experiments at this site in July 2016, changing this from a closed system to an open system. After 6 months of continuous flow, the hole ran dry and was closed and is now only opened for sampling trips and by safety personnel to mitigate pressure buildup."
